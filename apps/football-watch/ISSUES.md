# Next.js Server-side API Endpoint with route.js
- Problem: When error fetching from 3rd party API, how to return error from this side


- Problem: Why writing like in "C:\Users\hoang\Desktop\projects\hoangesoftblog.github.io\apps\football-watch\src\app\room\[id]\room.tsx", there will be 5-7 requests called? And when the code is syntax-wrong, it seems to got infinite loops (1000+ requests for 1-2s)?
